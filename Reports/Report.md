ABSTRACT
This project presents the conceptualization, design, and construction of a radio-controlled (RC) fixed-wing aircraft developed for the Techfest IIT Bombay Aeromodelling Competition 2025. The aircraft is designed to achieve optimal performance in both endurance and payload-carrying missions, adhering strictly to the dimensional and performance constraints outlined in the competition rulebook. The primary objectives of the design are to maximize aerodynamic efficiency, stability, and controllability while maintaining a low structural weight and high structural integrity.

SUMMARY

An iterative design approach was employed, involving aerodynamic simulation(in xflr5), airfoil selection, structural optimization, and propulsion system analysis. The chosen configuration is a high-wing monoplane with inherent stability and smoother flight characteristics. A lightweight yet rigid structure is achieved using a combination of balsa wood and foam(depron) board for the wing and fuselage, respectively. The S1223 or Clark Y airfoil is considered for its high lift coefficient and proven low-speed performance. Power is provided by a high-efficiency brushless DC motor coupled with a matching propeller and Li-Po battery, ensuring a thrust-to-weight ratio not exceeding 1 according to competition guidelines. Control is achieved via a standard 6-channel transmitter?receiver system (FS-i6) driving servos for elevator, rudder, and aileron actuation.

The design process integrates theoretical calculations with empirical testing and computational tools to optimize wing loading, center of gravity, and propulsion efficiency. The final aircraft is expected to demonstrate excellent stability, short takeoff distance, and efficient flight performance across all mission rounds of the competition.
